# Hungry-Bird
Birds take care of their young when they hatch. Newly born chicks depend on their parents to bring them food and require feeding every half-an-hour. Knowing this, we can now appreciate the diligence of the parent birds. They go from their nest to a food source, carry it in their beaks and go back to their nest to feed their young. This process continues at least until the baby birds’ feathers and muscles have developed sufficiently for flight. 

Work is based on a drone which seeks to emulate the 3-D navigation ability of the avian species. The drone performs a task routinely performed by most birds, namely going through the process of feeding itself and its young, and henceforth it's is called Hungry Bird and the drone is referred to as “Bird”. Through this I have tried to learn control system design and controlling a drone using the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform(V-REP). There are hoops referred as trees and the drone have to go through the hoops and return back to it's initial position.
